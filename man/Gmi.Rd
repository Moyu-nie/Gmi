\arguments{
\item{X}{A numeric matrix of predictors with dimensions n Ã— p.}

\item{y}{A numeric response vector of length n.}

\item{beta}{Initial values for regression coefficients. If NULL, initialized to zero.}

\item{penalty}{penalty Choose from \code{LASSO}, \code{SCAD} and \code{MCP}. Default
is 'SCAD'.}

\item{penalty.factor}{A multiplicative factor for the penalty applied to each coefficient. If supplied,
penalty.factor must be a numeric vector of length equal to the number of columns of X. The purpose of
penalty.factor is to apply differential penalization if some coefficients are thought to be more likely
than others to be in the model. In particular, penalty.factor can be 0, in which case the coefficient is
always in the model without shrinkage.}

\item{inter.penalty.factor}{The penalty factor for interactions effects. Default is 1.}

\item{lam.list}{A user supplied \eqn{\lambda} sequence.}

\item{lambda.min.ratio}{Optional input. smallest value for \code{lambda}, as
a fraction of \code{max.lam}, the (data derived) entry value. the default
depends on the sample size \code{n} relative to the number of variables}

\item{max.iter}{maximum number of iteration in the computation. Default is
100.}

\item{n.lambda}{The number of \code{lambda} values. Default is 100.}

\item{eps}{Tolerance threshold. Coefficients below this threshold
are treated as zero.}

\item{tune}{Tuning parameter selection method.
'AIC', 'BIC', 'EBIC' and 'GIC' are available options. Default is EBIC.}

\item{ebic.gamma}{the gamma parameter value in the EBIC criteria. Default is
1.}

\item{eta}{A scalar in between 0 and 1 that controls the proportion of \code{lambda} allocated to sparsity (lasso-type) versus fusion penalty.}
