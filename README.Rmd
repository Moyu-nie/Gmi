Gmi: Group-Level Main Effects and Interactions in High-Dimensional Data.

Gmi is a package for analyzing the high dimensional data with group-level main and interaction effetcs, developed by the Huazhen Lin's lab.

## Installation

You can install the development version of Gmi from [GitHub](https://github.com/), firstly, install the 'remotes' package.

``` r
install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("Moyu-nie/Gmi")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(Gmi)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
